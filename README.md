- C language

phase 2 covers: 
- ASM
- tools (mainly the build tools, toolchain from compiler front)

phase 3 covers:
- complete C language

- writing a firmware
- booting CPU from scratch
- writing the drivers

Environment used for all the exmples to run is:
- QEMU - emulator which behave as if it is a real board
- software emulation of the board
- RISC-V CPU -  reason being lot of info is available for this CPU online
